# Insaflu-upload

**A tool to upload Fastq files to the INSaFLU database and perform metagenomics pathogen detection**

## Introduction

The _insaflu-upload_ tool uploads fastq files to the INSaFLU database, and performs metagenomics pathogen detection. The tool relies on _mfmc_, a package to monitor and process Minion outputs.

The tool uploads the files generated by _mfmc_ to the insaflu database and performs metagenomics pathogen detection. It then generates a report with the results.

## Details

The user has the option to only upload the last file generated, or to upload all files generated by _mfmc_.

For upload, metadata files are generated for each sequence file. metadata files are stored in the metadata directory following the input directory structure. Metadata and Output directories are specified by the user can be the same.

### Upload

_insaflu-upload_ can interact with the INSaFLU in two ways:

- **Docker**. The user needs to have docker installed and running. The tool will then upload the files to the docker image. The user needs to provide the name of the docker image and the path for uploads.

- **SSH**. The user needs to have access to the database server. The tool will then upload the files to the database using SSH. The user needs to provide the path for uploads and the credentials for the database server.

### INSaFLU

THe tool creates one INSaFLU-TELEVIR project for each directory containing fastq files. The project name is the name of the directory. Files generated within the same directory are uploaded to the same project.

### Input Files

- **fastq.gz** - A directory containing fastq files. The files can be in subfolders. The files can be gzipped or not.

- **config.ini** - A configuration file containing the parameters for the tool. The file is generated by the tool when it is run for the first time. The user can edit the file to change the parameters.

Config must contain:

- section [INSAFLU] containing insaflu username and app directory path.

- (optional) section [SSH] containing ssh credentials: username, ip_address and rsa key;

- (optional) section [DOCKER] containing docker image name.

see example [config.ini](config.ini)

## USAGE

    ```bash

    usage: main_influ.py [-h] -i IN_DIR -o OUT_DIR [-t TSV_T_N] -d TSV_T_DIR [-s SLEEP] [-n TAG] [--config CONFIG] [--merge] [--upload {last,all}] [--connect {docker,ssh}] [--keep_names]

    Process fastq files.

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -i IN_DIR, --in_dir IN_DIR
                            Input directory
    -o OUT_DIR, --out_dir OUT_DIR
                            Output directory
    -t TSV_T_N, --tsv_t_n TSV_T_N
                            TSV template name
    -d TSV_T_DIR, --tsv_t_dir TSV_T_DIR
                            TSV template directory
    -s SLEEP, --sleep SLEEP
                            Sleep time
    -n TAG, --tag TAG     name tag, if given, will be added to the output file names
    --config CONFIG       config file
    --merge               merge files
    --upload {last,all}   file upload stategy (default: all)
    --connect {docker,ssh}
                            file upload stategy (default: all)
    --keep_names          keep original file names
    ```
